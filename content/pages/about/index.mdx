# About xJ4cks

Trained as an IT specialist in the US Air Force, I pursued a Psychology education and I now create images with midjourney as a passion project.

# About this Site

This is meant to function as a portfolio for my current imagery wrought with midjourney. It will likely expand to include more, as the world evolves.

# About midjourney 

What is midjourney? Simply put, it's a magical 2020s tech that creates imagery from word prompts.

More completely, it's a closed-source (proprietary code) tool based upon the open-source stable diffusion image generator. Diffusion generators work via training on approximately 1 gazillion images from human culture, in order to "learn" how to illustrate concepts-- these concepts are associated with input tokens (words), so users can create *novel images* by assembling tokens in unique ways.

# About AI Art

If you believe that all AI art is theft, than you also must believe that *the act of learning itself is theft*. Sounds untenable to me, but that's the logical position if you fully buy into the "theft" argument that's floating around lately.

Caveat: stable diffusion is open source, and anyone with enough patience can learn how to dramatically customize it, based upon custom inputs. They can, perhaps, train it on a corpus of images which they do not legally own the usage rights to. This is where the "theft" argument gains some traction, because it's ethically murky to use creative works in a way that obviously dodges current global copyright laws.

I stick with midjourney as my main tool in this field because its proprietary, for-profit nature guarantees that it complies with copyrights as fully as possible.

Thanks for reading, you're amazing.
